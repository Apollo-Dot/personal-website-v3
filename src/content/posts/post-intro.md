## Summery
Welcome everyone to v8 of my personal website! :3

A lot has changed in this version for example THREE.js has been removed from the stack and I have moved to using Astro for the main framework and not Preact like was the case for v7.

I'm keeping this post brief but look forward to updates in the future :3

## Goals
My main goals for v8 are...
- Keep the load size small
- Learn more CSS
- Share Projects, DevLogs, and other things I'm working on
- Stay Active with Development

## Tech Stack
The Tech stack as of writing this post is:
- Astro
- Tailwind CSS
- [Hero Patterns](https://heropatterns.com/)
